To unveil the relationship between these two factors the traffic has been calculated for all the turnstiles in 42nd - Port Authority station which is known to be the number one station of fare evasion crime throughout the year of 2018.

The graph prortrays a cluster of traffic in a specific day and the crime rate shown in the corresponding bars.

It is clear that the amount of traffic in a certain station is intertwined with the number of fare evasion crimes happening at that specific station. With that being said, the NYPD should focus the manpower of the officers around crowded stations.
